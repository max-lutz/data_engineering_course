## Question 1:
What happens when we execute dbt build --vars '{'is_test_run':'true'}' You'll need to have completed the "Build the first dbt models" video.
Answer: It applies a limit 100 only to our staging models


## Question 2:
What is the distribution between service type filtering by year 2020 data only, as done in the videos? You will need to complete "Visualising the data" videos, either using google data studio or metabase.
