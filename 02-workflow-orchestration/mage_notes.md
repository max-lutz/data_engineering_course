## What is orchestration?

It's a process of dependency management, facilitated through automation.

The data orchestrator manages scheduling, triggering, monitoring and even resource allocation.

Every workflow (DAG or pipeline) requires sequential steps.

A good orchestrator handles:
- workflow management
- Automation
- Error handling
- Recovery
- Monitoring alerting
- Resource optimization
- Observability
- Debugging
- Compliance/Auditing

## What is mage?

An open source pipeline tool for orchestrating, transforming and integrating data.

Projects --> Pipelines --> blocks --> load
                                  --> transform
                                  --> export
