# Week 1 Docker and terraform

## Docker

Use docker-compose to setup a postgres database and a pgadmin service.
Use docker to run a python script to load data into the postgres database.

Features:
- Run three docker containers at the same time
- Connect the containers via a network
- Persist the data when shutting down the containers using volumes

Results:
```
root@localhost:ny_taxi> SELECT COUNT(1) FROM test
+---------+
| count   |
|---------|
| 7275986 |
+---------+
SELECT 1
Time: 0.794s
```


#### Useful commands
    # Build docker image
    docker build -t nyc_taxi_ingest:1.0 .

    # Check that postgres is running:
    pgcli -h localhost -U root -d ny_taxi

    # Ingest one month of data
    docker run --network pg_network -e PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 nyc_taxi_ingest:1.0 --user root --password root --host pgdatabase --port 5432 --db ny_taxi --table_name test --url https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2020-04.csv.gz





## Terraform:

Here we set up a bigquery dataset and a google cloud storage bucket using terraform


terraform commands used:
	terraform init
	terraform plan
	terraform apply
	terraform destroy

#### terraform plan

(base) max_lutz@data-engineering-course:~/data_engineering_course/01-docker-terraform/terraform$ terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are
indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_bigquery_dataset.demo_dataset will be created
  + resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "demo_dataset" {
      + creation_time              = (known after apply)
